# Machine-Learning-Models-Analysis-using-Yellowbrick
This is my API documentation for Yellowbrick Visualizers and API! It contains a complete listing of the currently available, production-ready visualizers along with code examples of how to use them. 


# Yellowbrick's Features
- Evaluate the stability and predictive value of machine learning models and improve the speed of the experimental workflow
- Provide visual tools for monitoring model performance in real-world applications
- Provide visual interpretation of the behavior of the model in high dimensional feature space.

# Yellowbrick Alternatives & Comparisons
WHAT ARE SOME ALTERNATIVES TO YELLOWBRICK?
- Snowflake: 
Snowflake eliminates the administration and management demands of traditional data warehouses and big data platforms. Snowflake is a true data warehouse as a service running on Amazon Web Services (AWS)â€”no infrastructure to manage and no knobs to turn.


- MemSQL: 
MemSQL converges transactions and analytics for sub-second data processing and reporting. Real-time businesses can build robust applications on a simple and scalable infrastructure that complements and extends existing data pipelines.


- Hadoop: 
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.


- TensorFlow: 
TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. The flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile device with a single API.


- PyTorch: 
PyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolothic C++ framework. It is built to be deeply integrated into Python. You can use it naturally like you would use numpy / scipy / scikit-learn etc.
